# Polynom
### Author: Jessica Blau
This project was made to let the user create functions and do any operations to these functions.
After operating on these functions, it will save the complex function as a finished product and print it on the screen within a graph.
This project has four different functions, and each is built to react a complex function at the end of the process.
The four classes that are in this project are:

##### Monom – which creates a basic function in the form of ax^b. (a = the natural number that is the base. x = the variable in the function. B = the coefficient of this function.)
#
##### Polynom – which creates a basic function in the form of ax^b+cx^d. (This function is created out of multiple monoms.)
#
##### ComplexFunction – which is a complex function created out of multiple polynoms or monoms that are operated on. (Operation(function,function)
#
##### Functions_GUI – which is the class that takes these complex function and saves, writes, and draws these functions that are on file.
